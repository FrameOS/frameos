##  **libevdev** is a library for handling evdev kernel devices. It abstracts
##  the \ref ioctls through type-safe interfaces and provides functions to change
##  the appearance of the device.
##
##  Development of libevdev is discussed on
##  [input-tools@lists.freedesktop.org](http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/input-tools)
##  Please submit patches, questions or general comments there.
##
##  Handling events and SYN_DROPPED
##  ===============================
##
##  libevdev provides an interface for handling events, including most notably
##  SYN_DROPPED events. SYN_DROPPED events are sent by the kernel when the
##  process does not read events fast enough and the kernel is forced to drop
##  some events. This causes the device to get out of sync with the process'
##  view of it. libevdev handles this by telling the caller that a SYN_DROPPED
##  has been received and that the state of the device is different to what is
##  to be expected. It then provides the delta between the previous state and
##  the actual state of the device as a set of events. See
##  libevdev_next_event() and @ref syn_dropped for more information on how
##  SYN_DROPPED is handled.
##
##  Signal safety
##  =============
##
##  libevdev is signal-safe for the majority of its operations, i.e. many of
##  its functions are safe to be called from within a signal handler.
##  Check the API documentation to make sure, unless explicitly stated a call
##  is <b>not</b> signal safe.
##
##  Device handling
##  ===============
##
##  A libevdev context is valid for a given file descriptor and its
##  duration. Closing the file descriptor will not destroy the libevdev device
##  but libevdev will not be able to read further events.
##
##  libevdev does not attempt duplicate detection. Initializing two libevdev
##  devices for the same fd is valid and behaves the same as for two different
##  devices.
##
##  libevdev does not handle the file descriptors directly, it merely uses
##  them. The caller is responsible for opening the file descriptors, setting
##  them to O_NONBLOCK and handling permissions. A caller should drain any
##  events pending on the file descriptor before passing it to libevdev.
##
##  Where does libevdev sit?
##  ========================
##
##  libevdev is essentially a `read(2)` on steroids for `/dev/input/eventX`
##  devices. It sits below the process that handles input events, in between
##  the kernel and that process. In the simplest case, e.g. an evtest-like tool
##  the stack would look like this:
##
##       kernel → libevdev → evtest
##
##  For X.Org input modules, the stack would look like this:
##
##       kernel → libevdev → xf86-input-evdev → X server → X client
##
##  For Weston/Wayland, the stack would look like this:
##
##       kernel → libevdev → Weston → Wayland client
##
##  libevdev does **not** have knowledge of X clients or Wayland clients, it is
##  too low in the stack.
##
##  Example
##  =======
##  Below is a simple example that shows how libevdev could be used. This example
##  opens a device, checks for relative axes and a left mouse button and if it
##  finds them monitors the device to print the event.
##
##  @code
##       struct libevdev *dev = NULL;
##       int fd;
##       int rc = 1;
##
##       fd = open("/dev/input/event0", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK);
##       rc = libevdev_new_from_fd(fd, &dev);
##       if (rc < 0) {
##               fprintf(stderr, "Failed to init libevdev (%s)\n", strerror(-rc));
##               exit(1);
##       }
##       printf("Input device name: \"%s\"\n", libevdev_get_name(dev));
##       printf("Input device ID: bus %#x vendor %#x product %#x\n",
##              libevdev_get_id_bustype(dev),
##              libevdev_get_id_vendor(dev),
##              libevdev_get_id_product(dev));
##       if (!libevdev_has_event_type(dev, EV_REL) ||
##           !libevdev_has_event_code(dev, EV_KEY, BTN_LEFT)) {
##               printf("This device does not look like a mouse\n");
##               exit(1);
##       }
##
##       do {
##               struct input_event ev;
##               rc = libevdev_next_event(dev, LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_NORMAL, &ev);
##               if (rc == 0)
##                       printf("Event: %s %s %d\n",
##                              libevdev_get_event_type_name(ev.type),
##                              libevdev_get_event_code_name(ev.type, ev.code),
##                              ev.value);
##       } while (rc == 1 || rc == 0 || rc == -EAGAIN);
##  @endcode

##
##  Backwards compatibility with older kernel

##  libevdev attempts to build and run correctly on a number of kernel versions.
##  If features required are not available, libevdev attempts to work around them
##  in the most reasonable way. For more details see \ref backwardscompatibility.

##  @page syn_dropped SYN_DROPPED handling
##
##  This page describes how libevdev handles SYN_DROPPED events.
##
##  Receiving SYN_DROPPED events
##  ============================
##
##  The kernel sends evdev events separated by an event of type EV_SYN and
##  code SYN_REPORT. Such an event marks the end of a frame of hardware
##  events. The number of events between SYN_REPORT events is arbitrary and
##  depends on the hardware. An example event sequence may look like this:
##  @code
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X        9
##   EV_ABS   ABS_Y        8
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT   0
##   ------------------------
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X        10
##   EV_ABS   ABS_Y        10
##   EV_KEY   BTN_TOUCH    1
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT   0
##   ------------------------
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X        11
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT   0
##  @endcode
##
##  Events are handed to the client buffer as they appear, the kernel adjusts
##  the buffer size to handle at least one full event. In the normal case,
##  the client reads the event and the kernel can place the next event in the
##  buffer. If the client is not fast enough, the kernel places an event of
##  type EV_SYN and code SYN_DROPPED into the buffer, effectively notifying
##  the client that some events were lost. The above example event sequence
##  may look like this (note the missing/repeated events):
##  @code
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X        9
##   EV_ABS   ABS_Y        8
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT   0
##   ------------------------
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X        10
##   EV_ABS   ABS_Y        10
##   EV_SYN   SYN_DROPPED  0
##   EV_ABS   ABS_Y        15
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT   0
##   ------------------------
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X        11
##   EV_KEY   BTN_TOUCH    0
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT   0
##  @endcode
##
##  A SYN_DROPPED event may be recieved at any time in the event sequence.
##  When a SYN_DROPPED event is received, the client must:
##  * discard all events since the last SYN_REPORT
##  * discard all events until including the next SYN_REPORT
##  These event are part of incomplete event frames.
##
##  Synchronizing the state of the device
##  =====================================
##
##  The handling of the device after a SYN_DROPPED depends on the available
##  event codes. For all event codes of type EV_REL, no handling is
##  necessary, there is no state attached. For all event codes of type
##  EV_KEY, EV_SW, EV_LED and EV_SND, the matching @ref ioctls retrieve the
##  current state. The caller must then compare the last-known state to the
##  retrieved state and handle the deltas accordingly.
##  libevdev simplifies this approach: if the state of the device has
##  changed, libevdev generates an event for each code with the new value and
##  passes it to the caller during libevdev_next_event() if
##  @ref LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_SYNC is set.
##
##  For events of type EV_ABS and an event code less than ABS_MT_SLOT, the
##  handling of state changes is as described above. For events between
##  ABS_MT_SLOT and ABS_MAX, the event handling differs.
##  Slots are the vehicles to transport information for multiple simultaneous
##  touchpoints on a device. Slots are re-used once a touchpoint has ended.
##  The kernel sends an ABS_MT_SLOT event whenever the current slot
##  changes; any event in the above axis range applies only to the currently
##  active slot.
##  Thus, an event sequence from a slot-capable device may look like this:
##  @code
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   10
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   100
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   80
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##  @endcode
##  Note the lack of ABS_MT_SLOT: the first ABS_MT_POSITION_Y applies to
##  a slot opened previously, and is the only axis that changed for that
##  slot. The touchpoint in slot 1 now has position 100/80.
##  The kernel does not provide events if a value does not change, and does
##  not send ABS_MT_SLOT events if the slot does not change, or none of the
##  values within a slot changes. A client must thus keep the state for each
##  slot.
##
##  If a SYN_DROPPED is received,  the client must sync all slots
##  individually and update its internal state. libevdev simplifies this by
##  generating multiple events:
##  * for each slot on the device, libevdev generates an
##    ABS_MT_SLOT event with the value set to the slot number
##  * for each event code between ABS_MT_SLOT + 1 and ABS_MAX that changed
##    state for this slot, libevdev generates an event for the new state
##  * libevdev sends a final ABS_MT_SLOT event for the current slot as
##    seen by the kernel
##  * libevdev terminates this sequence with an EV_SYN SYN_REPORT event
##
##  An example event sequence for such a sync may look like this:
##  @code
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         0
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   10
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   100
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   80
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         2
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   8
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_PRESSURE     12
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##  @endcode
##  Note the terminating ABS_MT_SLOT event, this indicates that the kernel
##  currently has slot 1 active.
##
##  Synchronizing ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID
##  ================================
##
##  The event code ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID is used to denote the start and end of
##  a touch point within a slot. An ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID of zero or greater
##  denotes the start of a touchpoint, an ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID of -1 denotes
##  the end of a touchpoint within this slot. During SYN_DROPPED, a touch
##  point may have ended and re-started within a slot - a client must check
##  the ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID. libevdev simplifies this by emulating extra
##  events if the ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID has changed:
##  * if the ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID was valid and is -1, libevdev enqueues an
##    ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID event with value -1.
##  * if the ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID was -1 and is now a valid ID, libevdev
##    enqueues an ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID event with the current value.
##  * if the ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID was a valid ID and is now a different valid
##    ID, libevev enqueues an ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID event with value -1 and
##    another ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID event with the new value.
##
##  An example event sequence for such a sync may look like this:
##  @code
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         0
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  -1
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         2
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  -1
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##   ------------------------
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   100
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   80
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         2
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  45
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   8
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_PRESSURE     12
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##  @endcode
##  Note how the touchpoint in slot 0 was terminated, the touchpoint in slot
##  2 was terminated and then started with a new ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID. The touchpoint
##  in slot 1 maintained the same ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID and only updated the
##  coordinates. Slot 1 is the currently active slot.
##
##  In the case of a SYN_DROPPED event, a touch point may be invisible to a
##  client if it started after SYN_DROPPED and finished before the client
##  handles events again. The below example shows an example event sequence
##  and what libevdev sees in the case of a SYN_DROPPED event:
##  @code
##
##             kernel                  |              userspace
##                                     |
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         0    |    EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         0
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  -1   |    EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  -1
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0    |    EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##   ------------------------          |    ------------------------
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  30   |
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   100  |
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   80   |
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0    |           SYN_DROPPED
##   ------------------------          |
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  -1   |
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0    |
##   ------------------------          |    ------------------------
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1    |    EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   90   |    EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   90
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   10   |    EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   10
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0    |    EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##  @endcode
##  If such an event sequence occurs, libevdev will send all updated axes
##  during the sync process. Axis events may thus be generated for devices
##  without a currently valid ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID. Specifically for the above
##  example, the client would receive the following event sequence:
##  @code
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         0       ← LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_NORMAL
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_TRACKING_ID  -1
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##   ------------------------
##   EV_SYN   SYN_DROPPED         0       → LIBEVDEV_READ_STATUS_SYNC
##   ------------------------
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   100     ← LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_SYNC
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   80
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##   -----------------------------        → -EGAIN
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_SLOT         1       ← LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_NORMAL
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_X   90
##   EV_ABS   ABS_MT_POSITION_Y   10
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##   -------------------
##  @endcode
##  The axis events do not reflect the position of a current touch point, a
##  client must take care not to generate a new touch point based on those
##  updates.
##
##  Discarding events before synchronizing
##  =====================================
##
##  The kernel implements the client buffer as a ring buffer. SYN_DROPPED
##  events are handled when the buffer is full and a new event is received
##  from a device. All existing events are discarded, a SYN_DROPPED is added
##  to the buffer followed by the actual device event. Further events will be
##  appended to the buffer until it is either read by the client, or filled
##  again, at which point the sequence repeats.
##
##  When the client reads the buffer, the buffer will thus always consist of
##  exactly one SYN_DROPPED event followed by an unspecified number of real
##  events. The data the ioctls return is the current state of the device,
##  i.e. the state after all these events have been processed. For example,
##  assume the buffer contains the following sequence:
##
##  @code
##   EV_SYN   SYN_DROPPED
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X               1
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X               2
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X               3
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X               4
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X               5
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X               6
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##  @endcode
##  An ioctl at any time in this sequence will return a value of 6 for ABS_X.
##
##  libevdev discards all events after a SYN_DROPPED to ensure the events
##  during @ref LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_SYNC represent the last known state of the
##  device. This loses some granularity of the events especially as the time
##  between the SYN_DROPPED and the sync process increases. It does however
##  avoid spurious cursor movements. In the above example, the event sequence
##  by libevdev is:
##  @code
##   EV_SYN   SYN_DROPPED
##   EV_ABS   ABS_X               6
##   EV_SYN   SYN_REPORT          0
##   @endcode
##
## *
##  @page backwardscompatibility Compatibility and Behavior across kernel versions
##
##  This page describes libevdev's behavior when the build-time kernel and the
##  run-time kernel differ in their feature set.
##
##  With the exception of event names, libevdev defines features that may be
##  missing on older kernels and building on such kernels will not disable
##  features. Running libevdev on a kernel that is missing some feature will
##  change libevdev's behavior. In most cases, the new behavior should be
##  obvious, but it is spelled out below in detail.
##
##  Minimum requirements
##  ====================
##  libevdev requires a 2.6.36 kernel as minimum. Specifically, it requires
##  kernel-support for ABS_MT_SLOT.
##
##  Event and input property names
##  ==============================
##  Event names and input property names are defined at build-time by the
##  linux/input.h shipped with libevdev.
##  The list of event names is compiled at build-time, any events not defined
##  at build time will not resolve. Specifically,
##  libevdev_event_code_get_name() for an undefined type or code will
##  always return NULL. Likewise, libevdev_property_get_name() will return NULL
##  for properties undefined at build-time.
##
##  Input properties
##  ================
##  If the kernel does not support input properties, specifically the
##  EVIOCGPROPS ioctl, libevdev does not expose input properties to the caller.
##  Specifically, libevdev_has_property() will always return 0 unless the
##  property has been manually set with libevdev_enable_property().
##
##  This also applies to the libevdev-uinput code. If uinput does not honor
##  UI_SET_PROPBIT, libevdev will continue without setting the properties on
##  the device.
##
##  MT slot behavior
##  =================
##  If the kernel does not support the EVIOCGMTSLOTS ioctl, libevdev
##  assumes all values in all slots are 0 and continues without an error.
##
##  SYN_DROPPED behavior
##  ====================
##  A kernel without SYN_DROPPED won't send such an event. libevdev_next_event()
##  will never require the switch to sync mode.

##  @page kernel_header Kernel header
##
##  libevdev provides its own copy of the Linux kernel header file and
##  compiles against the definitions define here. Event type and event code
##  names, etc. are taken from the file below:
##  @include linux/input.h
##
## *
##  @page static_linking Statically linking libevdev
##
##  Statically linking libevdev.a is not recommended. Symbol visibility is
##  difficult to control in a static library, so extra care must be taken to
##  only use symbols that are explicitly exported. libevdev's API stability
##  guarantee only applies to those symbols.
##
##  If you do link libevdev statically, note that in addition to the exported
##  symbols, libevdev reserves the <b>_libevdev_*</b> namespace. Do not use
##  or create symbols with that prefix, they are subject to change at any
##  time.
##
## *
##  @page testing libevdev-internal test suite
##
##  libevdev's internal test suite uses the
##  [Check unit testing framework](http://check.sourceforge.net/). Tests are
##  divided into test suites and test cases. Most tests create a uinput device,
##  so you'll need to run as root, and your kernel must have
##  CONFIG_INPUT_UINPUT enabled.
##
##  To run a specific suite only:
##
##      export CK_RUN_SUITE="suite name"
##
##  To run a specific test case only:
##
##      export CK_RUN_TEST="test case name"
##
##  To get a list of all suites or tests:
##
##      git grep "suite_create"
##      git grep "tcase_create"
##
##  By default, Check forks, making debugging harder. The test suite tries to detect
##  if it is running inside gdb and disable forking. If that doesn't work for
##  some reason, run gdb as below to avoid forking.
##
##      sudo CK_FORK=no CK_RUN_TEST="test case name" gdb ./test/test-libevdev
##
##  A special target `make gcov-report.txt` exists that runs gcov and leaves a
##  `libevdev.c.gcov` file. Check that for test coverage.
##
##  `make check` is hooked up to run the test and gcov (again, needs root).
##
##  The test suite creates a lot of devices, very quickly. Add the following
##  xorg.conf.d snippet to avoid the devices being added as X devices (at the
##  time of writing, mutter can't handle these devices and exits after getting
##  a BadDevice error).
##
##      $ cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-ignore-libevdev-devices.conf
##      Section "InputClass"
##              Identifier "Ignore libevdev test devices"
##              MatchProduct "libevdev test device"
##              Option "Ignore" "on"
##      EndSection
##
##
## *
##  @defgroup init Initialization and setup
##
##  Initialization, initial setup and file descriptor handling.
##  These functions are the main entry points for users of libevdev, usually a
##  caller will use this series of calls:
##
##  @code
##  struct libevdev *dev;
##  int err;
##
##  dev = libevdev_new();
##  if (!dev)
##          return ENOMEM;
##
##  err = libevdev_set_fd(dev, fd);
##  if (err < 0) {
##          printf("Failed (errno %d): %s\n", -err, strerror(-err));
##
##  libevdev_free(dev);
##  @endcode
##
##  libevdev_set_fd() is the central call and initializes the internal structs
##  for the device at the given fd. libevdev functions will fail if called
##  before libevdev_set_fd() unless documented otherwise.
##
## *
##  @defgroup logging Library logging facilities
##
##  libevdev provides two methods of logging library-internal messages. The
##  old method is to provide a global log handler in
##  libevdev_set_log_function(). The new method is to provide a per-context
##  log handler in libevdev_set_device_log_function(). Developers are encouraged
##  to use the per-context logging facilities over the global log handler as
##  it provides access to the libevdev instance that caused a message, and is
##  more flexible when libevdev is used from within a shared library.
##
##  If a caller sets both the global log handler and a per-context log
##  handler, each device with a per-context log handler will only invoke that
##  log handler.
##
##  @note To set a context-specific log handler, a context is needed.
##  Thus developers are discouraged from using libevdev_new_from_fd() as
##  important messages from the device initialization process may get lost.
##
##  @note A context-specific handler cannot be used for libevdev's uinput
##  devices. @ref uinput must use the global log handler.
##
## *
##  @defgroup bits Querying device capabilities
##
##  Abstraction functions to handle device capabilities, specificially
##  device properties such as the name of the device and the bits
##  representing the events suppported by this device.
##
##  The logical state returned may lag behind the physical state of the device.
##  libevdev queries the device state on libevdev_set_fd() and then relies on
##  the caller to parse events through libevdev_next_event(). If a caller does not
##  use libevdev_next_event(), libevdev will not update the internal state of the
##  device and thus returns outdated values.
##
## *
##  @defgroup mt Multi-touch related functions
##  Functions for querying multi-touch-related capabilities. MT devices
##  following the kernel protocol B (using ABS_MT_SLOT) provide multiple touch
##  points through so-called slots on the same axis. The slots are enumerated,
##  a client reading from the device will first get an ABS_MT_SLOT event, then
##  the values of axes changed in this slot. Multiple slots may be provided in
##  before an EV_SYN event.
##
##  As with @ref bits, the logical state of the device as seen by the library
##  depends on the caller using libevdev_next_event().
##
##  The Linux kernel requires all axes on a device to have a semantic
##  meaning, matching the axis names in linux/input.h. Some devices merely
##  export a number of axes beyond the available axis list. For those
##  devices, the multitouch information is invalid. Specfically, if a device
##  provides the ABS_MT_SLOT axis AND also the (ABS_MT_SLOT - 1) axis, the
##  device is not treated as multitouch device. No slot information is
##  available and the ABS_MT axis range for these devices is treated as all
##  other EV_ABS axes.
##
##  Note that because of limitations in the kernel API, such fake multitouch
##  devices can not be reliably synched after a SYN_DROPPED event. libevdev
##  ignores all ABS_MT axis values during the sync process and instead
##  relies on the device to send the current axis value with the first event
##  after SYN_DROPPED.
##
## *
##  @defgroup kernel Modifying the appearance or capabilities of the device
##
##  Modifying the set of events reported by this device. By default, the
##  libevdev device mirrors the kernel device, enabling only those bits
##  exported by the kernel. This set of functions enable or disable bits as
##  seen from the caller.
##
##  Enabling an event type or code does not affect event reporting - a
##  software-enabled event will not be generated by the physical hardware.
##  Disabling an event will prevent libevdev from routing such events to the
##  caller. Enabling and disabling event types and codes is at the library
##  level and thus only affects the caller.
##
##  If an event type or code is enabled at kernel-level, future users of this
##  device will see this event enabled. Currently there is no option of
##  disabling an event type or code at kernel-level.
##
## *
##  @defgroup misc Miscellaneous helper functions
##
##  Functions for printing or querying event ranges. The list of names is
##  compiled into libevdev and is independent of the run-time kernel.
##  Likewise, the max for each event type is compiled in and does not check
##  the kernel at run-time.
##
## *
##  @defgroup events Event handling
##
##  Functions to handle events and fetch the current state of the event.
##  libevdev updates its internal state as the event is processed and forwarded
##  to the caller. Thus, the libevdev state of the device should always be identical
##  to the caller's state. It may however lag behind the actual state of the device.

##  Get the next event from the device. This function operates in two different

##
##  In normal mode (when flags has @ref LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_NORMAL set), this
##  function returns @ref LIBEVDEV_READ_STATUS_SUCCESS and returns the event
##  in the argument @p ev. If no events are available at this
##  time, it returns -EAGAIN and ev is undefined.
##
##  If the current event is an EV_SYN SYN_DROPPED event, this function returns
##  @ref LIBEVDEV_READ_STATUS_SYNC and ev is set to the EV_SYN event.
##  The caller should now call this function with the
##  @ref LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_SYNC flag set, to get the set of events that make up the
##  device state delta. This function returns @ref LIBEVDEV_READ_STATUS_SYNC for
##  each event part of that delta, until it returns -EAGAIN once all events
##  have been synced. For more details on what libevdev does to sync after a
##  SYN_DROPPED event, see @ref syn_dropped.
##
##  If a device needs to be synced by the caller but the caller does not call
##  with the @ref LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_SYNC flag set, all events from the diff are
##  dropped after libevdev updates its internal state and event processing
##  continues as normal. Note that the current slot and the state of touch
##  points may have updated during the SYN_DROPPED event, it is strongly
